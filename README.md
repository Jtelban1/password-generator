# password-generator

I set up my var params as length, uppercase, lowercase. special characters and numerical characters.

I put my length params in a loop to make sure my password lenth was between 8 and 128

I then assign  my variables

I made sure that our params length promp was changed from an string value to an integer.

I then delcared a function of "generate password" which will take in our params. 

The function will be a for loop, in which i will set up my "if" statements.

The array i use will include the math.random() which will give me a random value.

I want to duplicate this array and I use function in order to do so.

So I create a function called "getRandomValue" by taking a "string" as an arguement and then base of that "string" I get a random value from that "string".


then at my return password function i will slice and shorten up the "string" that the  user specified.
